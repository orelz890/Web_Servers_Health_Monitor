# Web Servers Monitoring System üåêüîç


## Description
The Web Servers Monitoring System is designed to enable real-time health monitoring of web servers in the cloud. Utilizing Flask and SQLAlchemy, this Python application provides a robust API for managing web server records and performing automated health checks based on various network protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SSH.




## Project Architecture
This project follows a multi-layered architecture designed to separate concerns and promote code reusability and modularity:
- **API Layer:** [app](app/app.py), [routes](api/routes.py): Flask routes that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic and service routines : [webserverServices](services/webserverServices.py), [ProtocolHandler](services/ProtocolHandler.py) acts as a worker class within the scheduler threading model.
- **Model Layer:** [models](models/models.py): Database schema definitions using SQLAlchemy.
- **Scheduler Layer:** [scheduler](scheduler/scheduler.py), [threadpoolManager](scheduler/threadpoolManager.py): Utilizes APScheduler for scheduling tasks and a custom **thread pool** to enhance performance by concurrent execution of health checks.
- **Protocol Handler Layer:** [Factory](services/protocolHandlerFactory.py): Implements the factory design pattern to manage different protocol handlers, supporting [HTTP-Handler](services/HTTPSchedulerService.py), [FTP-handler](services/FTPSchedulerService.py), and [SSH-Handler](services/SSHSchedulerService.py) protocols through a unified interface.


### OOP Principles and Design
The Web Servers Monitoring System employs key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Encapsulation:** Secures object data within well-defined interfaces.<br>
- **Inheritance:** Uses abstract base classes for code reusability and streamlined protocol handler extensions.<br>
- **Polymorphism:** Employs a common interface for diverse protocol handlers, enhancing system flexibility.<br>
- **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):** Ensures a consistent interface across all protocol handlers, guaranteeing implementation integrity.<br>
- **Factory Pattern:** Simplifies the addition of new protocol handlers through ProtocolHandlerFactory, maintaining adherence to the open/closed principle.<br>
- **Singleton Pattern:** Manages single instances of essential resources like database connections to optimize efficiency and avoid conflicts.


## Capabilities üöÄ
This system offers comprehensive functionalities for web server management and automated health monitoring, ensuring real-time oversight and maintenance. Here are the key capabilities:

**1. Add a New Webserver** üåê<br>
Allows the creation of new web server records by specifying their name and HTTP URL. This is crucial for expanding the monitoring scope as new servers go live.

**2. List All Webservers** üìã<br>
Provides a complete listing of all registered webservers, including detailed information such as name, URL, and current health status. This feature is essential for administrative oversight and operational checks.

**3. Update Webserver Details** üõ†Ô∏è<br>
Enables updates to webserver details, supporting changes in URL or names as server configurations evolve. This ensures that monitoring remains accurate and reflective of the current network topology.

**4. Delete a Webserver** ‚ùå<br>
Facilitates the removal of webservers from monitoring when they are decommissioned or no longer needed. This helps in maintaining a clean and relevant list of active servers.

**5. Get Webserver Health and Request History** üìä<br>
Retrieves the health status and a history of the monitoring requests for individual servers. This is vital for diagnosing issues, understanding patterns, and making informed decisions about infrastructure health.

**6. Automated Health Checks** üè•<br>
Conducts automated health checks at scheduled intervals, assessing each webserver against predefined success criteria related to response codes and latency. This automatic surveillance is crucial for proactive maintenance and ensures high availability.

**7. Periodic Cleanup of Old Data** üßπ<br>
Automatically deletes request histories that are more than a week old every Sunday at midnight. This scheduled cleanup helps in maintaining the database efficiency by removing outdated data, ensuring that the system storage is optimized and performance remains high.


These capabilities collectively provide a robust framework for real-time monitoring and management of web servers, enhancing system reliability and performance.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
- **APScheduler**: To schedule periodic health checks.
- **Requests**: To make HTTP requests to web servers.
- **GitHub Projects**: Helps in visually organizing and prioritizing tasks.


## Database Normalization
The **database is normalized to 3NF** (Third Normal Form) to avoid data redundancies and maintain data integrity. This ensures that:
- All tables have a primary key.
- There are no repeating groups or arrays.
- All attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key in their respective tables.





## Setup and Installation


### Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher and pip should be installed on your system. You can install all dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
Update the `app/config.py` with the correct settings for your environment. Here is an example configuration:
```python
class Config:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/mydatabase'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
```
Replace `username`, `password`, and `mydatabase` with your MySQL user, password, and database name.

### Running the Application
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the Flask server:
```bash
python main.py
```

<!-- ## API Usage
Refer to the included Postman collection (`Web_Servers_Monitoring_System.postman_collection.json`) to explore and test the API endpoints. This collection provides pre-configured requests for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting web server records, as well as fetching their health statuses and request histories. -->
